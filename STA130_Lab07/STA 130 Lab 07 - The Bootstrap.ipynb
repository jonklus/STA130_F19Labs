    "The Central Limit Theorem was key in formulating the specific confidence interval for the estimate of the mean of a population we talked about in class.  For instance,  because the CLT says that the sample mean is normally distributed ($\\bar{X} \\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}})$), we can use the standard normal table to get critical values for the confidence interval.  These critical values scale the standard error of $\\bar{X}$\n",
    "(or any point estimator) to cover the desired level of confidence (e.g.  95%).  What if we didn’t have the CLT to tell us where to get these critical values from?  The goal of this lab is to investigate how to use bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals."

Thus,  if  we  have 1,000 bootstrap samples and a 95% confidence interval,  our lower bound will be the 25th lowest estimate our upper bound will be the 975th lowest estimate (25th largest estimate)."
