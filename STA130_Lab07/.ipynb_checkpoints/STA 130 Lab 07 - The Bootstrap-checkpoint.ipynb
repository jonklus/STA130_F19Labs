    "The Central Limit Theorem was key in formulating the specific confidence interval for the estimate of the mean of a population we talked about in class.  For instance,  because the CLT says that the sample mean is normally distributed ($\\bar{X} \\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}})$), we can use the standard normal table to get critical values for the confidence interval.  These critical values scale the standard error of $\\bar{X}$\n",

    "4.  Look  at  the  distribution  of  your $m$ estimates  (the  “bootstrap  distribution”).   If  it is  roughly  symmetric,  you  may  proceed. (There  is  another  method  for  asymmetric distributions, but we won’t get into that here.)\n",

Thus,  if  we  have 1,000 bootstrap samples and a 95% confidence interval,  our lower bound will be the 25th lowest estimate our upper bound will be the 975th lowest estimate (25th largest estimate)."
