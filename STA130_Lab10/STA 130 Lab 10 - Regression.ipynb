    "- **IA**: impervious area ($\\%$), found as portion of map covered by road, parking lots, roofs, etc.\n",

    "Before fitting the model, you may need to transform your variables so that the independent variables have linear relationships with the dependent one.  A good way to judge this is to simply plot the target variable ($Y$) versus one of the predictors ($X_j$, $j = 1,...,p$) of interest at a time.  (Hint:  see the OpenIntro Stats text here at\n",
    "https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php and particularly the section s 8.2.2 on model selection strategies and 8.2.3 on checking model assumptions using graphs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Python library `statsmodels` to build our regression models. Note that model-building can also be accomplished using the package `scikitlearn`, which includes many more models and helpful features but takes a machine learning approach to model building. We will be focusing on the basic elements of the model, for which `statsmodels` is much more transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the goal when building a model should be parimony parsimony. You want to have the most powerful, yet simplest model you can build. Thus, you would like to find the model that maximizes $Adj-R^2$."
