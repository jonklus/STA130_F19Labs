    "In this lab you will be working with a dataset from the The World Meteorological Organization which contains data about people affected by the 2017 Hurricane Irma. The goal in this lab is to use logistic regression to model the probability that an individual survives a hurricane. Take some time to review the supplemental material provided in class about logistic regression as well as the description of data provided within this project. "

The function we use for logistic regression takes the following form: `logistic = stats.glm(response, predictor, data = dataframe, family = 'binomial')`. In this function, glm stands for generalized linear model. The option setting family equal to binomial indicates that the response is binary (Poisson is another option here in which the response would be count data). Run a `summary()` on the logistic model you just created. Does SWIM appear to be a significant predictor at the $\\alpha=.05$ level? How about the $\\alpha=.01$ level? "
